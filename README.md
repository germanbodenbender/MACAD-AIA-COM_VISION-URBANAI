// HOW TO START

01 + Clone the repository and run the "AIA_COM_VISION_G04_URBAN_AI_PCA_ANALYSIS" on colab to perform a PCA analysis.

02 + Once the analysis is done, open and run the "AIA_COM_VISION_G04_URBAN_AI_ML_REGRESSION_MULTI_PRECITION_V05" file on colab as well to train the model.

03 + Once the model is trained, you can save the .h5 file and add it onto your local repository

04 + Open VS and select the "app.py" file. Load the saved .h5 fle onto the code.

05 + Open the provided Grasshopper file and load the provided URL from the Visual Studio terminal onto Hops.
